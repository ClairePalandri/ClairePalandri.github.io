      *I.e., what does it mean to do inferential statistics, and where does applied microeconometrics fit in the tree of all these methods.*
      
      *-- Idea of this document: when we are doing applied microeconometrics, we must not forget we are really doing some inferential statistics. What does that mean?*
      
      *- Content: things like 'a model is a probability distribution, are the assumptions behind our inference workflow satisfied? ...*
