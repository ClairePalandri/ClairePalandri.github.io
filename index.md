  - #### **Microeconometrics in Inferential Statistics**: [pdf](microeconometrics.pdf)

       *What does it mean to do inferential statistics, and where do applied microeconometrics fit in the tree of all these methods.*
      
       *(When we are doing applied microeconometrics, we are really doing some inferential statistics. What does that mean? --> 'models as probability distributions', inference workflow ...)*
      
      
  - #### **Causal inference in observational studies, *Theory & Methods***: [pdf](causal inference.pdf)

      *A specialty of applied econometrics: using regression to uncover the **causal effect** of a treatment on a population.*
      
      *1. Our underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes*
      
      *2. Applied methods (RDD, IV...). Importantly: equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes (i.e., "this method really recovers what I want")*
      
      *3. Improving our inference (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)*
          

  - #### **Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)**: [pdf](CLRM&estimators.pdf)

      *The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture. But a lot of assumptions are made along the way. What are they & what do they imply?*
      
      *1. Typical assumptions.*
      
      *2. What do they provide? (estimator properties)*
      
      *3. What to do when they are violated?*
  
  
  - #### **Probability distributions in regression modeling**: [pdf](proba_theory.pdf)

      *The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make all of this work.*
