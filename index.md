  - ##### Microeconometrics in Inferential Statistics: [pdf](microeconometrics.pdf)

      *I.e., what does it mean to do inferential statistics, and where does applied microeconometrics fit in the tree of all these methods.*
      
          *-- Idea: when we are doing applied microeconometrics, we must not forget we are really doing some inferential statistics. What does that mean?*
      
          *-- Content: 'models as probability distributions', inference workflow ...*

  - ##### Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail): [pdf](CLRM&estimators.pdf)

      *The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture. But a lot of assumptions are made along the way. What are they and what do they imply?*
      
          *1. Describing exactly and succinctly these assumptions.*
          *2. What do they provide? (estimator properties)*
          *3. What to do when they are violated?*

      *The statistics theory essential definitions & theorems that make all of this work.*
      
          *-- Content: definitions (moments...), theorems (LLN & CLT), ...*
