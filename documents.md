Applied statistics

  - [Microeconometrics within Inferential Statistics](../data/microeconometrics.pdf)  
Applied econometrics is one branch of inferential statistics. What does that mean? --> *'models as probability distributions', inference workflow ...*
      
      
  - [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../data/causal_inference.pdf)  
Using regression to uncover the **causal effect** of a treatment on a population.
      * Our underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
      * Applied methods (RDD, IV...). Importantly: equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes (i.e., "this method really recovers what I want")
      * Improving our inference (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)  <br/><br/>

      
  - [Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)](../data/CLRM&estimators.pdf)  
The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture. But a lot of assumptions are made along the way. What are they & what do they imply?  
      	1. Typical assumptions\\
      	2. What do they provide? (estimator properties)\\
      	3. What to do when they are violated?

      
  - [Probability distributions in regression modeling](../data/proba_theory.pdf)  
The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make all of this work.<br/><br/>

Data wrangling

  - [Wrangling spatial data in R](../data/spatialData_R.pdf)
