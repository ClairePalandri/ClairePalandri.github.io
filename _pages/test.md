## Working papers

  - **Water contamination by Animal Feeding Operations: Evidence from Iowaand North Carolina**  *(Draft available upon request)*  
<span style="font-size:0.7em; line-height:0.7em;">
The majority of U.S. animal farming takes place in industrial Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs), where large quantities of manure are produced, stored, then typically spread onto fields. The concentration of animal waste is thought to threaten environmental and public health, as airborne and mal farming takes place in industrial Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs), where large quantities of manure are produced, stored, then typically spread onto fields. The concentration...

  - [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../docs/causal_inference.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">
Using regression to uncover the causal effect of a treatment on a population.  
    *   The underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
    *   Applied methods (RDD, IV...); equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes
    *   Improving inferences (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)



  - [Assumptions of the classical linear regression modelâ€”and what to do when they fail](../docs/CLRM&estimators.pdf)  
    1. Typical assumptions
    2. What do they provide? (Estimator properties)
    3. What to do when they are violated?
