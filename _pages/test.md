  - **Water contamination by Animal Feeding Operations: Evidence from Iowaand North Carolina**  *(Draft available upon request)*  
<span style="font-size:0.7em; line-height:0.8em;">
The majority of U.S. animal farming takes place in industrial Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs), where large quantities of manure are produced, stored, then typically spread onto fields. The concentration of animal waste is thought to threaten environmental and public health, as airborne and ...

  - **Causal Inference Workshop (Ph.D.)** \
I designed a PhD-level course on causal inference for interdisciplinary research, and led it for the PhD students in Sustainable Development at Columbia University in the Spring of 2022. [Syllabus](../docs/CIworkshop_syllabus.pdf)

<span style="font-size:0.85em;">
Using regression to uncover the causal effect of a treatment on a population.  
    *   Underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
    *   Applied methods (RDD, IV...); equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes
    *   Improving inferences (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)
