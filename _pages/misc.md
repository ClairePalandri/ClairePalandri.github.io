This page contains misc. documents for applied econometrics research, that I update regularly.
<span style="font-size:0.7em;">
(Originally personal notes, then used as foundation for teaching PhD students, now dumped online in case they can be useful to others.)
</span>  


## Applied statistics

  - [Microeconometrics within Inferential Statistics](../docs/microeconometrics.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
Applied econometrics is one branch of inferential statistics. What does that mean? &rarr; *Models as probability distributions; inference workflow ...*
</span>  
      
      
  - [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../docs/causal_inference.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
Using regression to uncover the causal effect of a treatment on a population.
</span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;">     1. Underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes </span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;">     2. Applied methods (RDD, IV...); equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes </span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;">     3. Improving one's inference (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...) </span>  


      
  - [Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)](../docs/CLRM&estimators.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture, which rests on a lot of assumptions. What are they & what do they imply? </span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 1. Typical assumptions </span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 2. What do they provide? (estimator properties) </span>
    <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> 3. What to do when they are violated? </span>  
 
      
  - [Probability distributions in regression modeling](../docs/proba_theory.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make all of this work.
</span>  


## Data wrangling

  - [Wrangling spatial data in R](../docs/spatialData_R.pdf)
