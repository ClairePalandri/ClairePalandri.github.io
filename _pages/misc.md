[//]: <> This page contains misc. documents for applied research.

This page contains misc. documents for applied econometrics research, that I update regularly.
<span style="font-size:13px;">
Originally personal notes, later used as foundation for teaching PhD students, now dumped online in case they would be useful to others.</span>


## Applied statistics

  - [Microeconometrics within Inferential Statistics](../docs/microeconometrics.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:15px;">
Applied econometrics is one branch of inferential statistics. What does that mean? --> *'models as probability distributions', inference workflow ...*</span>
      
      
  - [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../docs/causal_inference.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:15px;">
Using regression to uncover the **causal effect** of a treatment on a population.
      * The underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
      * Applied methods (RDD, IV...). Importantly: equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes
      * Improving one's inference (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)</span>

      
  - [Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)](../docs/CLRM&estimators.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:15px;">The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture. However, it rests on a lot of assumptions. What are they & what do they imply?  
      	1. Typical assumptions\\
      	2. What do they provide? (estimator properties)\\
      	3. What to do when they are violated?</span>

      
  - [Probability distributions in regression modeling](../docs/proba_theory.pdf)  
<span style="font-size:15px;">The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make all of this work.</span><br/><br/>


## Data wrangling

  - [Wrangling spatial data in R](../docs/spatialData_R.pdf)
