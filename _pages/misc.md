Misc. documents for applied econometrics research, updated regularly.

(Originally personal notes on applied statistics, later used as foundation for teaching PhD students, now dumped online in case they would be useful to others.)</span>


## Applied statistics

  - [Microeconometrics within Inferential Statistics](../docs/microeconometrics.pdf)  
Applied econometrics is one branch of inferential statistics. What does that mean? --> *'models as probability distributions', inference workflow ...*
      
      
  - [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../docs/causal_inference.pdf)  
Using regression to uncover the **causal effect** of a treatment on a population.
      * The underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
      * Applied methods (RDD, IV...). Importantly: equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes (i.e., "this method really recovers what I want")
      * Improving one's inference (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)  <br/><br/>

      
  - [Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)](../docs/CLRM&estimators.pdf)  
The two documents above mainly paint the textbook picture. However, it rests on a lot of assumptions. What are they & what do they imply?  
      	1. Typical assumptions\\
      	2. What do they provide? (estimator properties)\\
      	3. What to do when they are violated?

      
  - [Probability distributions in regression modeling](../docs/proba_theory.pdf)  
The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make all of this work.<br/><br/>


## Data wrangling

  - [Wrangling spatial data in R](../docs/spatialData_R.pdf)
