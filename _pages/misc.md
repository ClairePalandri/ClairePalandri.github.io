Below are misc. documents for applied econometrics research, that I update irregularly.
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
    (Originally personal notes, then used as foundation for teaching PhD students, now put online in case they can be useful to others.)
</span>  

## Applied statistics
- [Probability distributions in regression modeling](../docs/proba_theory.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">
The essential statistics definitions & theorems (esp. LLN & CLT) that make the statistics below work.
</span>  

- [Microeconometrics within Inferential Statistics](../docs/microeconometrics.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">
Basic inferential statistics most commonly used in applied microeconometrics. _Models as probability distributions; inference workflow ..._
</span>  
      
- [Causal inference in observational studies, Theory & Methods](../docs/causal_inference.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">
Using regression to uncover the causal effect of a treatment on a population.  
    1. Underlying theoretical framework: potential outcomes
    2. Applied methods (RDD, IV...); equivalence of the regression slope estimate in terms of potential outcomes
    3. Improving inferences (matching & controls, falsification tests, randomization inference...)
  
- [Assumptions of the classical linear regression model (and what to do when they fail)](../docs/CLRM&estimators.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
    1. Typical assumptions
    2. What do they provide? (Estimator properties)
    3. What to do when they are violated?

## Data wrangling

- [Wrangling spatial data in R](../docs/spatialData_R.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
