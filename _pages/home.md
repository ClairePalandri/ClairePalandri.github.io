[//]: <> Comment

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

I earned my Ph.D. from Columbia University’s program in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development){:target="_blank"}, which cultivates an interdisciplinary approach — heavily grounded in economics and statistics — to studying socio-ecological systems.

I'm deeply interested in the evolving relationship between human societies and domesticated animals and its role in sustainability. I also care about fostering cross-disciplinary research to address questions for sustainable development. My work centers on:

  - **Animal farming** and trade-offs across system forms, from artisanal to industrial;
  - Integrating **statistical methods** across disciplines to support collaboration.
