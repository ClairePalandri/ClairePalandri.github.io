[//]: <> Comment

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University’s program in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development){:target="_blank"}, which cultivates an interdisciplinary approach — heavily grounded in economics — to studying socio-ecological systems.

I'm deeply interested in the relationship between human societies and domesticated animals, and its key role in sustainability. I also strongly believe that cross-disciplinary research is crucial for addressing the challenges of sustainable development. My work centers on:

  - **Animal farming systems,** especially the economic trade-offs linked to industrialization;
  - Integrating **statistical methods** across disciplines.
