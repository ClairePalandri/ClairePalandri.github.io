[//]: <> I am a postdoctoral scholar at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago.

I will be joining the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral scholar in August 2022.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia Universityâ€™s program in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development){:target="_blank"}, which cultivates an interdisciplinary approach to address emerging challenges within socio-ecological systems.

I strive in my research to bring together the insights and methodological strengths of multiple disciplines in order to address such questions, and notably to study the **animal farming system**. I am deeply interested in the relation between humans and domesticated animals, and in the role it may play in the socio-ecological transition. My main research interests relate to 2 areas:

  - The diverse forms of animal farming systems, from artisanal to industrial, and the tradeoffs that they entail;
  - Bridging differences between the statistical approaches of disciplines whose collaborative work is needed on such interdisciplinary questions.

[//]: <>  My work revolves around / One of my main research interests is the heterogeneity of forms of the animal farming system, and the tradeoffs that they entail.
