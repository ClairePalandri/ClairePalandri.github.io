[//]: <> Comment

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University’s program in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development){:target="_blank"}, which cultivates an **interdisciplinary** approach — grounded in **economics** — to studying socio-ecological systems.

My research examines what makes systems resilient, how they generate health and environmental risks, and how policy can address these challenges.  
Many applications focus on **animal agriculture** — a critical sector for sustainability that renews attention to the relationship between human societies and domesticated animals.
