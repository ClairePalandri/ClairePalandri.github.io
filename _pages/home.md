I will be joining the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral scholar in August 2022.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University’s program in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development){:target="_blank"}, which cultivates an interdisciplinary approach to address emerging challenges within socio-ecological systems.

I strive in my research to bring together the insights and methodological strengths — esp. in statistical approaches — of multiple disciplines in order to address such questions, and notably to study a particular system: **animal farming**. I am deeply interested in the relation between humans and domesticated animals, and in its role in the socio-ecological transition. One of my main research interests is the heterogeneity of forms of the animal farming system, and the tradeoffs that they entail.
